                        <p>Hi, I'm Sannakki Madhuri, and I am pursuing Btech from the University of Anathapur asa degree of Electronics and Communication Engineering.My current GPA is 78% till the 5th semister. I completed my schooling in Milton Grammer Enlish Medium High school,Adoni.I scored 90% in my 12th and 88% in my 10th.I learned programming languages like C,Core Java,HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT as my technical skills.Currently, I'm practising and 
                             upgrading my skills as a user-experience designer. I love solving problems and designing solutions.
                              I'm focused on creating simple and meaningful experiences through design.Talking about my hobbies, I like to 
                             play chess with my family and friends, plant more and more plants, and read or explore
                              technical terms, and I always try to share my knowledge because my father is from the 
                              education department.I always try to do my work on my own. I look at life very positively.
                             I am a firm believer in the fact that whatever happens, happens for a good reason. I have good 
                             communication skills.I can talk to any strange person very comfortably. I am also a good listener.
                            Talking about My weakness is I trust people easily and Talk too much.My short-term goal is to become
                             financially independent.My long-term goal is to become a highly skilled software engineer and learn the 
                             necessary skills.That's all about me.Thank you, sir......</p>
